Looking at the challenge there are following modules.

1. Extract the data from any given source.
2. Process the data based on the given rule.
3. Generate the report in any given format.

This is basically ET(Extract and Transform).

For this I have created 3 frameworks.

################### Created framework short explain (More details available in "Created Frameworks explanation.txt") ##########

1. Batchprocess Framework : Since Extract and transform is step execution, First step is extracting the data and next step is transform
So this framework will help us do any kind of step execution with feature like chunk process, preprocess handling Post process handling.

2. Extractor Framework : This is used to extract the data from any provided way, Currently we have two TXTFileDataExtractor and 
ExcelFileDataExtractor, But it can be extended to support any kind of medium, (Even rest api)

Extractor simply extract the data from from given source and mapping logic to map data to POJO is separate from extractor
Which is done by providing a mapperFunction in extractor.


3. Report Framework : This framework provide the way to generate the report and can be extended by any custom report.
for more info check "Created Frameworks explanation" txt file.

Note: All these 3 frameworks work independently to each other and can be packed a separate jars to use anywhere else if required.
 
 
#################### Fee calculator ##################

With the use of above 3 created frameworks.

1. Data is extracted from any source.
2. Fee is calculated by given rule.
3. Report is generated.

Because we have batchrunner we can add any step in future if required like Loader step or multiple report generation step
or notification step to the owner.
