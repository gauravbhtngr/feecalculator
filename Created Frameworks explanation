######################## Batchprocess Framework ####################################

#BatchRunner
This is used to do batch processing of any kind of batch, This help us to do batch processing in chunks supports many other 
operations like sending emails before some work or do any operations before and after step.

This chains the Batch steps and execute those once batch is started.
 
Currently supported batch steps
CollectionStep and SupplierStep

For each step you can provide preprocessing consumer and postProcessing consumer

#SimpleBatchRunner
This is the simple implementation of BatchRunner


#UnitTest for SimpleBatchRunner
test public void execute() to check it execute all the configured steps.

test private void start(BatchStep step) to check if the start step is not SupplierStep then throw exception.


##################### Extractor Framework ########################

#DataExtractor
 
This is an interface with one extract method which takes MapperFunction as argument to decide how we want to map extracted data to
Our POJO

We have two type of extractors 
1. TXTFileDataExtractor which read from txt file after that extract and map data based on provided MapperFunction.
1. ExcelFileDataExtractor which read from excel file after that extract and map data based on provided MapperFunction.

Configuration object that support two parameters currently 
1. path : File path 
2. headerEnabled (default value is true) : If the file we want to feed has headers or now. 

DataExtractor extract data based on provided Configuration object.

##################### Report Framework ##################################

#Generator 
IReportGenerator is an interface that has one method generate that takes IReport as an agrument.

#IReport<T> is an interface that has 
contract for Header, FilePath, Objects and writer.

Any implementation class will need to provide their own headers, filepath, collection objects and a writer

#ReportWriter is an interface with one method getText 
any implementation of this writer will have to process the provided object and return a text that will be appear in the report
